# ryser

A project born from the fact that mpc-hc lags a BIT when used with Kodi. Will hopefully do all of Kodi's functionalities I care about & be prettier too.

Using Tauri, Rust & React

# Installation

NO RELEASE YET. Soon: Download the latest release and install anywhere other than Program Files.

# Configuration

If you haven't installed mpc-hc to the default location or want to use something else add path and args of your video player to config.json.\
Go wild on the .css files inside /styles/
